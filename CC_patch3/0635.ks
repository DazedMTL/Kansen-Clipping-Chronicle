"Ugh...!"[pcms]
*7954|
[fc]
As soon as I stepped out into the stands, a tragedy unfolded before my[r]
eyes.[pcms]
*7955|
[fc]
There were no monsters in the stands, and the pool below was in full[r]
view. Scattered here and there were the bodies of people who had been[r]
attacked and killed.[pcms]
*7956|
[fc]
The main pool was stained bright red with blood, and several bodies[r]
were floating in it. Members of the swim team from other schools, as[r]
well as members of the painting club, were among them.[pcms]
*7957|
[fc]
At several places poolside, I could see female club members being[r]
swarmed and violated. Some even seemed to be actively engaging in an[r]
orgy.[pcms]
*7958|
[fc]
Next to them, someone was biting into a bright red lump, greedily[r]
tearing at it and scattering a yellowish-pink, squishy object around.[pcms]
*7959|
[fc]
The sight was so horrific that Riri turned pale and froze on the spot.[pcms]
*7960|
[fc]
Suda and I had seen this scene before... but that doesn't mean you get[r]
used to it. I suppressed the nausea that was rising with sheer[r]
willpower and looked around the poolside.[pcms]

*7963|

Kind, hardworking, a bit unreliable but...[pcms]
*7964|

The teacher who would come down to our level to show concern and[r]

[backlay][chara_int][trans time=150 method=crossfade][wt]
*7965|
[fc]
While struck with a strong shock, my eyes still wandered in search of[r]
one important person--[pcms]

"Rui-senpai!!"[pcms]

*7967|
[fc]
I found her on top of the 10-meter high diving platform.[pcms]
*7968|
[fc]
Armed with a cleaning deck brush, she was fending off the monster-[r]
transformed swim team members who were pressing in on her.[pcms]
*7969|
[fc]
Just like I saw earlier, they seem to have a weakness for steps, as[r]
they can't quite make it up, causing them to gather at the bottom of[r]
the stairs.[pcms]
*7970|
[fc]
Some fall into the diving pool, which is still clean, and drown as[r]
they sink.[pcms]
*7971|
[fc]
Because of this, few can make it up to her, and despite being in a[r]
desperate situation, Rui-senpai seemed to be able to fend them off[r]
with her deck brush.[pcms]
*7972|
[fc]
However, from here I can see that their numbers are steadily[r]
increasing, so it's only a matter of time before she's cornered.[pcms]

[backlay][chara_int][bg storage="BG11a"][trans time=300 method=crossfade][wt2]
*7978|
[fc]
We need to hurry and help her... but how?[pcms]
*7979|
[fc]
Below us was a terrifying number of monsters, and it didn't seem[r]
possible to scatter or break through them.[pcms]
*7980|
[fc]
Moreover, the monsters heard our exchange and started gathering even[r]
more.[pcms]
*7981|
[fc]
These creatures really only have their target in sight.[pcms]
*7982|
[fc]
Because they're only looking at us as they walk, some fall into the[r]
pool and drown, while others trip over bodies and crash down, smashing[r]
their faces.[pcms]
*7983|
[fc]
If we use this to our advantage, maybe we can guide the monsters.[pcms]
*7984|
[fc]
At the edge of the stands where we are, there's a staircase leading to[r]
the pool.[pcms]
*7985|
[fc]
If we can lure the monsters to the opposite side of the pool, maybe we[r]
can create an opportunity for Rui-senpai to jump down and take refuge[r]
in the stands.[pcms]
*7986|
[fc]
It's a risky plan, but it's better than slowly losing ground like[r]
this.[pcms]
*7987|
[fc]
[ns]Akira[nse]
"Alright, listen up everyone. We're going to lead them... Suda?"[pcms]
*7988|
[fc]
When I turned around to explain the plan to everyone, Suda's behavior[r]
seemed odd. His eyes were shining brightly as he stared at Nenohi-san.[pcms]
*7989|

I was about to ask what was wrong when Suda's arms wrapped around[r]
Nenohi-san before I could speak.[pcms]

"Sorry, Akira... I seem to have been a bit clumsy."[pcms]

Returning Riri was dragging her foot. Could it be that she hurt[r]
herself when Suda pushed her?[pcms]

"I can walk okay, but... it seems impossible to run."[pcms]
*8076|
[fc]
That's a problem...[pcms]
*8077|
[fc]
So the option to run away in case of emergency is gone. Plus, our[r]
greatest strength on this side has diminished.[pcms]

[ns]Akira[nse]
"...How much do you weigh?"[pcms]
*8079|
[fc]
I asked while looking at Riri's hips. Judging by the size of her big[r]
butt, it seems like it might be considerable.[pcms]
*8080|
[fc]
Even if I carry her on my back, my stamina won't last long.[pcms]

"What does that have to do with anything?!"[pcms]
*8082|
[fc]
It does matter... but even at a time like this, is it still an issue[r]
she doesn't want to be touched upon?[pcms]
*8083|
[fc]
Can't be helped, anyway, I'll have to figure something out if it comes[r]
down to it...[pcms]

As I was deep in thought, Rui-senpai's somber voice called out to me.[pcms]
*8086|
[fc]
When I turned around, Rui-senpai's eyes were on the floor of the[r]
stands-- directed at Suda, who was still lying there.[pcms]

"...Yes."[pcms]
*8089|
[fc]
We nodded to Rui-senpai's words.[pcms]
*8090|
[fc]
For a moment, the words "I killed Suda" almost slipped out of my[r]
throat. But I swallowed them with determination.[pcms]
*8091|
[fc]
I'm not a monk or a priest, and even if I confessed, Rui-senpai[r]
wouldn't be able to say anything.[pcms]
*8092|
[fc]
I shouldn't talk about such unnecessary worries just because I want to[r]
feel better.[pcms]
*8093|
[fc]
Especially at a time like this.[pcms]

"Anyway, let's get out of here and hide for now. Ideally, we should[r]
enter the forest but..."[pcms]
*8095|
[fc]
Riri has hurt her foot, and Rui-senpai is barefoot. Entering the[r]
forest at night in such a state would be too dangerous underfoot.[pcms]

"Then how about heading towards the old building? There were fewer[r]
users there, so maybe there aren't as many of them..."[pcms]
*8097|
[fc]
That's true... There's also the option of tents at the edge of the[r]
campsite, but the old building is closer.[pcms]
*8098|
[fc]
It might be better to rest there first and regroup.[pcms]

"Then let's head to the old building... Rui-senpai, is that okay with[r]
you?"[pcms]

"Yeah, that sounds good. I don't have a good grasp of the situation,[r]
so I'll leave it to your judgment."[pcms]
*8101|
[fc]
While saying this, Rui-senpai picked up a bag that had fallen beside[r]
Suda's body. It was the bag we had divided our belongings into[r]
earlier.[pcms]

[ns]Akira[nse]
"...Suda, I'm sorry... goodbye."[pcms]
*8103|
[fc]
In my heart--I succinctly expressed the whirlwind of emotions swirling[r]
through my body and placed a towel from the bag over Suda's head.[pcms]
*8104|
[fc]
To at least not continue exposing his tragic figure any longer--[pcms]

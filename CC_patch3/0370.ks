After running for a while since then, I realized we had reached the[r]
lake, right in front of the center.[pcms]
*2875|
[fc]
In front of the center, a bus that seemed to have fled from somewhere[r]
had overturned, blocking the entrance.[pcms]
*2876|
[fc]
Moreover, beyond that, flames were rising, and thick black smoke was[r]
billowing, making it impossible to approach.[pcms]
*2877|
[fc]
For sure, the overturned bus was burning. If not that, then some other[r]
vehicle must have been on fire.[pcms]
*2878|
[fc]
Metal was being scorched, along with paint, resin, leather, gasoline.[pcms]
*2879|
[fc]
And other things too--surely, human hair and skin--various things were[r]
burning, spreading a smell so foul it twisted your face.[pcms]
*2880|
[fc]
We finally made it here, slipping through the smoke and the "abnormal[r]
ones" attacking us.[pcms]

The rental boat Riri mentioned was quickly found, and conveniently,[r]

However, the boat wasn't floating on the lake but was propped up[r]

All sorts of things must be sticking out everywhere. My feet, which[r]

"Senior...?"[pcms]
*2986|
[fc]
Having struck senior on the head, blood rushed away from my head and I[r]
found myself staring at her serene face floating on the water surface.[pcms]

[fc]
Senior Rui's face was as beautiful as ever.[pcms]
*2988|
[fc]
--The only difference was the color of her eyes.[pcms]
*2989|
[fc]
Whether it was because of being hit or some other reason, they were a[r]
transparent red like spilling blood.[pcms]
*2990|
[fc]
I found myself staring into those bright red eyes of senior as she[r]
looked at me with a stern expression, as if being drawn in.[pcms]

"Thank you, Shibue-kun. Thanks to you, I was saved."[pcms]
*2992|
[fc]
With her red eyes still intact, Senior Rui, wearing her usual smile,[r]
sank straight down into the lake.[pcms]

[ns]yAkira[nse]
"Saved...? Senior Rui!? What are you saying? Senior! Senioooor!!!"[pcms]
*2994|
[fc]
Her usual chignon, tightly bound, came undone, spreading through the[r]
waters of Lake Tazawa along with the bright red blood.[pcms]
*2995|
[fc]
Senior's body sank through the crystal-clear water.[pcms]
*2996|
[fc]
I watched Senior sink into the abyss without moving a finger.[pcms]
*2997|
[fc]
One centimeter, ten centimeters.[pcms]
*2998|
[fc]
In the terribly, terribly deep water, Senior's pale, translucent body,[r]
her black hair, and the red blood all fell.[pcms]
*2999|
[fc]
She was getting further away, but I could still see her corpse clearly[r]
as I followed it with my eyes.[pcms]
*3000|
[fc]
Then--memories of Senior flooded my mind all at once.[pcms]
*3001|
[fc]
[ns]yAkira[nse]
"Sen...pai...ugh, ah, aaaaah!! Senior Rui!! Why, why is this[r]
happening! What's going on!"[pcms]
*3002|
[fc]
I collapsed on the boat, not caring that Riri was next to me, and[r]
sobbed loudly.[pcms]
*3003|
[fc]
My eyes burned and my throat hurt. Yet still, the tears wouldn't stop,[r]
and I couldn't suppress the rising sobs.[pcms]

[backlay][chara_int][trans time=150 method=crossfade][wt]
*3006|
[fc]
Embraced by Riri, like a child being soothed by his mother, I felt[r]
embarrassed and involuntarily averted my gaze.[pcms]
*3007|
[fc]
I could see the distant mountains over Riri's shoulder. And beyond[r]
that--was that the direction of the art gallery or Akita?[pcms]
*3008|
[fc]
Just before the day completely faded, a column of fire tore through[r]
the dark red clouds and stretched into the sky. Then, immediately[r]
after...a pure white flash spread out.[pcms]

A little later, a thunderous boom like a clap of thunder resounded.[pcms]
[bgm storage="bgm15" time=2000]
*3010|
[fc]
It happened only once.[pcms]
*3011|
[fc]
But that light and sound, reminiscent of the end of the world, pierced[r]
my heart and left it riddled with holes.[pcms]
*3012|
[fc]
Into those opened holes flowed a flood of cruel memories.[pcms]
*3013|
[fc]
The many friends I had lost that day.[pcms]
*3014|
[fc]
The best friend I had killed with my own hands. The person I admired,[r]
buried by my own hands.[pcms]
*3015|
[fc]
What comes next.[pcms]
*3016|
[fc]
As these filled every hole and sealed them,[pcms]
*3017|
[fc]
I felt tears overflowing from my eyes again while still thinking about[r]
what lay ahead.[pcms]
*3018|
[fc]
What will happen now? I can't even guess. But surely, I'll make it[r]
back alive.[pcms]
*3019|
[fc]
To my family, and to Kenkou. And when I meet everyone again--[pcms]
*3020|
[fc]
And Riri is here too. So surely, everything will work out.[pcms]
*3021|
[fc]
While muttering that, I wrapped my arms around Riri's body and hugged[r]
her gently.[pcms]
*3022|
[fc]
If Riri is by my side, I feel like everything will be okay. That's[r]
enough for now--[pcms]
*3023|
[fc]
[ns]yAkira[nse]
"Thank you, Riri."[pcms]
*3024|
[fc]
The words of gratitude spilled out unintentionally.[pcms]
*3025|
[fc]
But there was no reply.[pcms]
*3026|
[fc]
Maybe it was because of the pain. Or perhaps she was just exhausted.[r]
She seemed to have fallen asleep.[pcms]
*3027|
[fc]
Surely, that was it.[pcms]
*3028|
[fc]
I continued to drift gently over the darkening madder-red surface of[r]
the lake while embracing Riri's body.[pcms]
*3029|
[fc]
Quietly, very quietly.[pcms]
*3030|
[fc]
Listening only to my heartbeat and the sound of my breathing.[pcms]

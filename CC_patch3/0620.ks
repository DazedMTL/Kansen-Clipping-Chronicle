Riri also contacted her track and field club group line and found out[r]
that they were in a similar situation.[pcms]
*7791|
[fc]
Riri's parents were safe and had moved to a shelter where they were[r]
actively involved in measures against the mobs; several people had[r]
witnessed this and sent photos as well.[pcms]
*7792|
[fc]
That's good... I felt relieved too, but Riri was so relieved she[r]
almost cried.[pcms]
*7793|
[fc]
We took a photo of the three of us and sent it to each of our families[r]
to reassure them.[pcms]
*7794|
[fc]
At the same time, I sent a photo to the group line to let everyone[r]
know we were safe.[pcms]
*7795|
[fc]
However, only Ken'go is not good with these kinds of apps and hasn't[r]
created a group, so I have no choice but to contact him by email.[pcms]
*7796|
[fc]
Since communication conditions are better with apps, I should have[r]
forced him to use it...[pcms]
*7797|
[fc]
I briefly explained the situation at the center on the group line,[r]
sent out my prayers for everyone's safety, and put away my phone.[pcms]
*7798|
[fc]
We must avoid wasting it. I have to constantly be mindful of the[r]
battery level.[pcms]
*7799|
[fc]
Once that task was finished, it was time to look for weapons.[pcms]
*7800|
[fc]
Barbecue skewers. Two wooden bats. A small, portable shovel.[pcms]
*7801|
[fc]
These seem to be the only things that could be used as weapons.[pcms]
*7802|
[fc]
In a situation like this, surely...[pcms]

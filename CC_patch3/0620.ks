However, only Ken'go is not good with these kinds of apps and hasn't[r]
created a group, so I have no choice but to contact him by email.[pcms]
*7796|
[fc]
Since communication conditions are better with apps, I should have[r]
forced him to use it...[pcms]

I briefly explained the situation at the center on the group line,[r]
sent out my prayers for everyone's safety, and put away my phone.[pcms]

Once that task was finished, it was time to look for weapons.[pcms]

Barbecue skewers. Two wooden bats. A small, portable shovel.[pcms]

These seem to be the only things that could be used as weapons.[pcms]

In a situation like this, surely...[pcms]

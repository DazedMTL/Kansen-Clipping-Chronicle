Before noon.[pcms]
*632|
[fc]
We, the members of Gazen, had gathered in the center's cafeteria.[pcms]
*633|
[fc]
If you pull out the stored curtains, it becomes a room that can also[r]
serve as a meeting room, divided into reasonable sections.[pcms]
*634|
[fc]
But at this time, it seems like they're preparing for lunch, and the[r]
good smell coming from the kitchen is quite tough on our growing[r]
appetites.[pcms]
*635|
[fc]
I don't know if it's just me or if everyone feels the same--[pcms]
*636|
[fc]
Their figures, silently typing and checking emails, seem to be[r]
enduring hunger.[pcms]
*637|
[fc]
Suda, sitting next to me, muttered about looking up this morning's[r]
incident, but it seems he found nothing and is fiddling with his phone[r]
in frustration.[pcms]
*638|
[fc]
Well, an accident on a rural mountain road isn't something that would[r]
be reported so quickly, I guess.[pcms]
[backlay][rir_up_03_f07 layer=3 x="&sf.ri_up_x[3]" y="&sf.ri_up_y[0]"][trans time=150 method=crossfade][wt]
*639|
[fc]
I yawned lightly and looked up to meet eyes with Riri.[pcms]
*640|
[fc]
It's not strange for her to be here since it's a joint meeting[r]
including the track team, but for some reason, she looked guilty and[r]
averted her gaze from me.[pcms]
*641|
[fc]
...I've felt like someone's been watching me for a while now; could it[r]
have been Riri looking at me?[pcms]
*642|
[fc]
No, now's not the time to be saying things like "it's tough being a[r]
popular guy"...[pcms]
[backlay][chara_int][trans time=150 method=crossfade][wt]
*643|
[fc]
She must have seen the email I sent her earlier.[pcms]
*644|
[fc]
I had sent an email to Riri just before we arrived at the center.[pcms]
*645|
[fc]
Of course, the content was encouraging her to make up with Kengi.[pcms]
*646|
[fc]
I moderately blamed Riri and defended her in the email, trying to[r]
stimulate her guilt and provoke reflection...[pcms]
*647|
[fc]
The content suggested that not only Riri but also Kengi was equally at[r]
fault. I'm truly terrified of my own literary prowess, hahaha.[pcms]
*648|
[fc]
As I looked at Riri with self-satisfaction, she seemed to have made up[r]
her mind about something. It appears my eloquent email has touched her[r]
heart, and she's decided to accept my proposal honestly.[pcms]
*649|
[fc]
This fulfills my obligation to Kengi. Really, these two childhood[r]
friends are such a handful.[pcms]
*650|
[fc]
They're hopeless without me, both of them. They should prostrate[r]
themselves before my magnanimity and deep compassion and cry tears of[r]
gratitude.[pcms]

I wonder if her being late caused any problems.[pcms]

[fc]
Maybe the allocation of pool and ground usage times has changed.[pcms]
*660|
[fc]
It's only us from Gazen in the cafeteria, but we're not the only ones[r]
using the facilities.[pcms]
*661|
[fc]
Even if that's the case, it's not something I can do anything about.[r]
It's something for Senior Rui and the teachers to handle.[pcms]
*662|
[fc]
If I could help Senior Rui at a time like this, it might lead to an[r]
increase in her favorability towards me...[pcms]
*663|
[fc]
With nothing else to do, I start fiddling with my phone while thinking[r]
about such things.[pcms]
*664|
[fc]
I check a different news site than the one Suda was looking at[r]
earlier, but there's still no news about this morning's accident.[pcms]
*665|
[fc]
It's a site that posts a lot of local articles, but if it's not there,[r]
then it really hasn't been reported yet.[pcms]
*666|
[fc]
[【央】]
「ん……？」[pcms][endhact]
*667|
[fc]
I was so focused on searching for articles about this morning's[r]
accident that I didn't notice this top article... It's about the[r]
Tohoku Shinkansen making an emergency stop.[pcms]
*668|
[fc]
The reason seems to be a passenger causing a disturbance inside one of[r]
the trains bound for Tokyo...[pcms]
*669|
[fc]
[【央】]
「大丈夫か、顕悟のヤツ……」[pcms][endhact]
*670|
[fc]
By the time, it seems like it could be the Shinkansen Kengi was on; I[r]
hope he wasn't involved.[pcms]
*671|
[fc]
Even without that, I feel like I've been seeing a lot of news about[r]
violent incidents lately.[pcms]
*672|
[fc]
It doesn't seem so frequent in national news, but in local news, it[r]
feels like it's reported almost every day.[pcms]
*673|
[fc]
I wonder if it's just rural areas feeling agitated due to depopulation[r]
and economic downturn. Or maybe illegal drugs are spreading mainly[r]
through the countryside?[pcms]
*674|
[fc]
As I skim through other news titles, I see a list of traffic accidents[r]
and missing person cases.[pcms]
*675|
[fc]
With so many lined up... it seems likely that this morning's incident[r]
will soon be picked up by news sites as well.[pcms]
*676|
[fc]
It's a complex case of accidents and disappearances, for now.[pcms]
*677|
[fc]
...It's definitely creepy, that accident. Not just the accident[r]
itself, but there's something too deep about it that doesn't sit right[r]
with me.[pcms]
*678|
[fc]
When I search for articles on the site, they just keep coming up. Even[r]
within the prefecture, there's a clear increase in violent incidents,[r]
disappearances, and traffic accidents.[pcms]
*679|
[fc]
Among them are several cases like this morning's accident, where the[r]
driver of the crashed vehicle just disappears, sending chills down my[r]
spine.[pcms]
*680|
[fc]
Of course, there are cases where they're found quickly, but even then,[r]
the testimonies are vague, leading to suspicions of mental[r]
incompetence or drug use.[pcms]
*681|
[fc]
And with so many strange incidents and accidents happening, there[r]
seems to be an increase in people who speculate about them, with links[r]
to occult-like sites as well.[pcms]
*682|
[fc]
I'm not against that kind of thing either...[pcms]
*683|
[fc]
Driven by curiosity, I take a look at the site and see some very[r]
fitting investigations.[pcms]
*684|
[fc]
The incidents and accidents within the prefecture have surged over the[r]
past one to two weeks since the start of the summer cold epidemic...[pcms]
*685|
[fc]
It seems that the summer cold isn't just spreading in our prefecture[r]
but has started to spread to neighboring ones as well.[pcms]
*686|
[fc]
It's not like there's a logistics hub or a major distribution route[r]
here.[pcms]
*687|
[fc]
Yet the fact that this summer cold started in our prefecture and is[r]
spreading to others is a strange story, according to that[r]
investigation.[pcms]
[fadeoutbgm time=500]
*688|
[fc]
And the incidents and accidents that are increasing along with the[r]
summer cold...[pcms]
*689|
[fc]
On websites and forums that deal with internet occult topics--[pcms]
[bgm storage="bgm11" time=100]
*690|
[fc]
"The theory that Russia or the US military secretly transported[r]
chemical weapons," "Pathogens from the continent hidden among smuggled[r]
goods,"[pcms]
*691|
[fc]
"Developing symptoms after being bitten by a mutated mite," "Alien[r]
human experimentation theory,"[pcms]
*692|
[fc]
"The distribution of a new illegal drug,"[pcms]
*693|
[fc]
These theories are explained at length as if they were true.[pcms]
*694|
[fc]
Honestly, the content is so ridiculous it makes me laugh, but it's[r]
quite something in its own way...[pcms]
*695|
[fc]
[【央】]
「おっ……これなんか、結構……」[pcms][endhact]
*696|
[fc]
Among them, the one that seems somewhat credible is the "US military[r]
chemical weapons leak theory."[pcms]
*697|
[fc]
Looking at the linked article, there's an unexpectedly persuasive...[r]
or so it seems, investigation written at length.[pcms]
*698|
[fc]
Apparently, although it hasn't made the news, about two weeks ago near[r]
a Self-Defense Force air unit base in the prefecture, there was an[r]
incident where someone attacked passersby and residents' homes.[pcms]
*699|
[fc]
This base has been expanding for several years now and has also[r]
started to be used by US military units on a shared basis.[pcms]
*700|
[fc]
It was supposed to be part of a plan to distribute the burden of[r]
military bases across the country.[pcms]
*701|
[fc]
Anyway, the perpetrator of the attack near that base is said to be a[r]
US soldier.[pcms]
*702|
[fc]
Moreover, like the perpetrators of other violent incidents, they were[r]
apparently in a state of mental incompetence or under the influence of[r]
drugs.[pcms]
*703|
[fc]
If it had just been that, it would have been a scandal involving[r]
violent incidents by rowdy stationed troops that could have made[r]
national news.[pcms]
*704|
[fc]
Yet the fact that it was suppressed and not reported suggests a deeper[r]
darkness is being hidden.[pcms]
*705|
[fc]
That is because these soldiers were infected with a virus developed as[r]
a "biological weapon"--[pcms]
*706|
[fc]
The stationed troops and government who want to keep the importation[r]
of weapons and their very existence secret have covered up the facts.[pcms]
*707|
[fc]
And this virus is said to be the culprit behind the series of summer[r]
colds and various incidents and accidents.[pcms]
*708|
[fc]
Near this Suzurigamine area, there is indeed a biological research[r]
institute, and some claim it leaked from there.[pcms]
*709|
[fc]
This investigation is posted on the site with a disclaimer-like[r]
sentence stating that its truthfulness is unclear.[pcms]
*710|
[fc]
Indeed, it does make sense and might even seem plausible...[pcms]
*711|
[fc]
It's more convincing than other theories, at least.[pcms]

I wonder if she thinks I'm the kind of guy who believes in such[r]

[fc]
The thought makes me want to scream and run away, dive into Lake[r]
Tazawa, and cool off my flushed face from embarrassment.[pcms]
*726|
[fc]
Somehow managing to endure this disgrace, I look around and notice[r]
that the teachers have also arrived at the dining hall.[pcms]
*727|
[fc]
Was I so engrossed in these occult internet stories that I didn't[r]
notice?[pcms]

[fc]
Riri, who had also returned, is staring at me with eyes that have gone[r]
beyond disbelief to outright dismay.[pcms]
*729|
[fc]
Embarrassing...[pcms]

[fc]
Seeing her expression, which seems to fully convey those words, I'm[r]

The proceedings, led by Rui-senpai's emceeing, shift to a greeting by[r]
Professor Onodera that's unbelievably stuffy despite being[r]

I was worried it would be long... but perhaps because we arrived late,[r]
it was thankfully only about one-tenth the usual length.[pcms]

*745|
[fc]
What on earth is Rui-senpai talking about?[pcms]
[backlay][chara_int][trans time=150 method=crossfade][wt]
*746|
[fc]
Tofu Castella is a specialty of the southern part of the prefecture, a[r]
sweet made by adding sugar and eggs to drained tofu and baking it.[pcms]
*747|
[fc]
Banana Monaka is a specialty from the neighboring Aomori Prefecture, a[r]
Japanese confectionery using vanilla essence.[pcms]
*748|
[fc]
Tofu Castella has a simple taste, and Banana Monaka is sold in stores[r]
within the prefecture too; I end up eating it whenever it's around[r]
because I like banana flavor.[pcms]
*749|
[fc]
In other words, both are sweets, not tote bags.[pcms]
*750|
[fc]
Could it be bags containing Tofu Castella and Banana Monaka?[pcms]
*751|
[fc]
While tilting my head slightly, I go to pick up Professor Takahashi's[r]
luggage which is quite voluminous.[pcms]
*752|
[fc]
But why do women's luggage always have to be so much?[pcms]
*753|
[fc]
Even though it's for a week's stay, all of mine fits into one large[r]
sports bag.[pcms]
*754|
[fc]
As I ponder this, I look for the tote bags as instructed...[pcms]

While pondering various enigmas, I take the two mysterious tote bags[r]

[fc]
At that announcement, there's a momentary murmur followed by subdued[r]

But without showing any concern for the reaction, Rui-senpai claps her[r]

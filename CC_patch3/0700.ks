In the midst of yet another tunnel, fighting the oppressive sensation[r]
in my ears, I pull out my cellphone to check my emails.[pcms]

It seems like summer colds are going around; besides the old man,[r]
there are quite a few others coughing conspicuously. Maybe it's an[r]
epidemic?[pcms]
*9047|
[fc]
I think I should be careful too, but with people coughing all over in[r]
this enclosed space, I might have already caught it.[pcms]
*9048|
[fc]
The train is also incredibly crowded. The occupancy rate must be[r]
around 120%... or so they said.[pcms]
*9049|
[fc]
There are so many people that some are even standing in the aisles.[pcms]
*9050|
[fc]
It's still several hours to my mother's family home.[pcms]
*9051|
[fc]
I had hoped to relax on this trip. If it weren't for the people[r]
coughing, it could have been an enjoyable journey.[pcms]
*9052|
[fc]
Looking around, there are many families, chatting happily despite the[r]
cramped conditions.[pcms]
*9053|
[fc]
Amidst them all, I'm just sitting here alone, fiddling with my[r]
cellphone.[pcms]
*9054|
[fc]
My dad is busy, and my mom can't leave home this year either.[r]
Apparently, she's been called upon because of her role as the chief[r]
carpenter for the local festival.[pcms]
*9055|
[fc]
And mom is swamped with helping out with that.[pcms]
*9056|
[fc]
In the midst of all this, I'm the only one with nothing to do, just[r]
idly passing time, so it's off to Kamakura for me...[pcms]
*9057|
[fc]
[Åyå∞åÂÅz]
"Grandma, huh... It's been five years since we last met. I wonder if[r]
she still remembers me."[pcms]
*9058|
[fc]
"It might not be much longer now."[pcms]
*9059|
[fc]
When you hear something like that, there's no way you can say you[r]
won't go.[pcms]
*9060|
[fc]
I don't like to say it, but if I don't see her now, the next time[r]
might be at her funeral... that seems to be the situation.[pcms]
*9061|
[fc]
Plus, being the son of a carpenter, it seems I'm expected to fix up[r]
grandma's house.[pcms]
*9062|
[fc]
I was a bit irritated being "told" to do these things, but since I[r]
love both grandma and grandpa, I don't mind going to Kamakura itself.[pcms]

Back when we were just kids--[pcms]
[stopse buf=0]
*9069a|
[fc]
Back then, even Hiro and I would talk in tears about "growing hair[r]
down there."[pcms]
*9070|
[fc]
Riri was always with Hiro and me.[pcms]
*9071|
[fc]
Nobody ever brought it up, but surely Hiro, Riri, and I were all aware[r]
of each other in that way.[pcms]
*9072|
[fc]
But then one day, Hiro started showing interest in an older student[r]
named Rui-senpai.[pcms]
*9073|
[fc]
I thought Hiro was so grown-up for that.[pcms]
*9074|
[fc]
At the same time, I wondered what Riri would do?[pcms]
*9075|
[fc]
I wasn't really interested in that sort of thing, and Hiro said Rui-[r]
senpai was out of his league anyway.[pcms]
*9076|
[fc]
But Hiro, ever curious about the opposite sex, surely...[pcms]
*9077|
[fc]
...would confess to Riri and she would reciprocate, and they'd be in[r]
mutual love. That's what I thought.[pcms]
*9078|
[fc]
Moreover, I was in the going-home club while Hiro and Riri stayed late[r]
for their club activities. So I had no idea what they did after[r]
school.[pcms]
*9079|
[fc]
It would be hard for them to talk about it in front of me. They were[r]
probably dating already.[pcms]
*9080|
[fc]
That's what I had concluded.[pcms]

[backlay][black_toplayer][trans time=501 method=crossfade][wt2][hide_chara_int]
*9112|
[fc]
After that, we kept quiet about the fact that we had started dating.[r]

*9113|
[fc]
Such things were quickly found out by Hiro.[pcms]
*9114|

congratulated and supported us.[pcms]
*9115|

However--[pcms]
*9116|

I was bad at this kind of thing.[pcms]

[fc]
It seemed Riri felt the same way, and we didn't really get along too[r]
well.[pcms]
*9118|
[fc]
I thought dating was supposed to be sweet and fun.[pcms]
*9119|
[fc]
In reality, we never stopped bickering (though it was more like[r]
playful fighting), far from the couple I had imagined.[pcms]
*9120|
[fc]
Moreover, Hiro's name would come up in conversation often, and Riri[r]
even sent him pictures.[pcms]
*9121|
[fc]
"We're supposed to be dating."[pcms]
*9122|
[fc]
Thinking that way made me start to worry about Riri's actions. But[r]
since I also brought up Hiro often, I couldn't say much.[pcms]
[backlay][chara_int][bg storage="BGskyb"][trans time=500 method=crossfade][wt2]
[layopt layer=3 opacity=255]
*9123|
[fc]
Our strange relationship continued until a week before this summer[r]
vacation.[pcms]
*9124|
[fc]
I was finally invited to Riri's room.[pcms]
*9125|
[fc]
To Riri's room which I had never entered before.[pcms]
*9126|
[fc]
Riri said with her head down, "My parents aren't home today."[pcms]
*9127|
[fc]
The phrase sounded like something out of TV or manga, and I couldn't[r]
help but feel elated and nervous at the same time.[pcms]
*9128|
[fc]
"Am I going to have sex with Riri today?"[pcms]
*9129|
[fc]
We hadn't made much progress before, and there were the arguments and[r]
things about Hiro. All of that could be wiped clean today.[pcms]
*9130|
[fc]
Determined not to screw up, I ruminated over all the "first-time"[r]
information I had gathered up until now in my head.[pcms]
*9131|
[fc]
The "first experiences" that have been a frequent topic of[r]
conversation among us lately. So-and-so lost their virginity. So-and-[r]
so lost their virginity. That's all anyone talks about.[pcms]
*9132|
[fc]
That must have reached Riri's ears too. Maybe that's why she invited[r]
me over today.[pcms]
*9133|

She greeted me in provocative attire, wearing short pants and a tank[r]
top.[pcms]
*9137|
[fc]
She must have remembered that I said I liked that kind of outfit.[pcms]
*9138|
[fc]
I, for my part, brought her favorite "nama ankoromochi" --[pcms]
*9139|
[fc]
While frequently puffing air into my mouth to soothe the canker sore[r]
from brushing too much, I stepped into Riri's room.[pcms]
*9140|
[fc]
But how many hours has it been since then?[pcms]
*9141|

Without anything happening, the two of us just spent a foolish time[r]

In front of me, who was irritated with myself for not having the guts[r]

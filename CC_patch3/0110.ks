Well, I was planning to tell her when the time was right anyway...[pcms]
*231|
[fc]
KenkouKenkou is our childhood friendand Riri's boyfriend.[pcms]
*232|
[fc]
We lived in Ani City before moving to Gakan City. Kenkou and I were[r]
the same age and neighbors, so we played together almost every day.[pcms]
*233|
[fc]
Whenever Riri, who lived in Gakan but whose maternal grandparents were[r]
in Ani, came over, the three of us would play together.[pcms]
*234|
[fc]
Later on, my family moved to Gakan City for my education[pcms]
*235|
[fc]
and Kenkou started attending Gakan Senboku Academy, commonly known as[r]
Gakusen, from Ani City, so our trio's relationship continued.[pcms]
*236|
[fc]
Eventually, around the time I started to be attracted to Rui-senpai[r]
and harbored feelings for her, Riri and Kenkou began dating.[pcms]
*237|
[fc]
It was a happy occasion.[pcms]
*238|
[fc]
But both of them are usually so strong-willed that they only become[r]
shy and clumsy at times like this, seemingly always hiding their[r]
embarrassment with bickering.[pcms]
*239|
[fc]
It seems their bickering finally escalated into a big fight, and[r]
neither has apologized yet, leading us to this point.[pcms]
*240|
[fc]
I can't help but wonder what they're doing... but since he consulted[r]
me about it, there's no way I can just ignore it![pcms]
*241|
[fc]
After all, they're both my precious childhood friends.[pcms]
*242|
[fc]
Kenkou said he wanted to apologize as soon as possible.[pcms]

However, he has to go to his relatives' house in Kamakura today for[r]

Kenkou definitely wants to apologize directly.[pcms]
*250|
[fc]
But with Riri not responding to emails or GSN messages, when there's[r]

And... if it comes to mediating between Riri and Kenkou, there's no[r]
one else but me.[pcms]

[fc]
This time, it's probably just a minor complication, and they'll be[r]
back to being close again. But... these two are such a handful.[pcms]
*253|
[fc]
Since Kenkou lives in Ani and Riri in Gakan, it's difficult for them[r]
to meet outside of school...[pcms]

[fc]
Now that it's summer vacation, there's no chance of coming to school[r]
unless it's for club activities.[pcms]

[fc]
Kenkou isn't in any clubs, so he naturally won't be coming to[r]
school...[pcms]
*256|
[fc]
As a result, when things get complicated like this, the noble excuse[r]
of going to see Riri disappears, so there's hardly any chance of[r]
bumping into each other in town.[pcms]
*256a|
[fc]
Yeah... after all, living in Gakan and being able to meet Riri right[r]

[fc]
The bus driver rushed over and spoke to him; despite holding his[r]
chest, he responded, so he seemed to be conscious.[pcms]
*499|
[fc]
The SUV that had been rammed had its front smashed so terribly that[r]
the driver's door was open.[pcms]
*500|
[fc]
There was no driver in sight, but on the road was a stark spread of[r]
bright red blood.[pcms]
*501|
[fc]
I could clearly tell it was blood, yet I--[pcms]
*502|
[fc]
Felt as if it wasn't real, staring blankly at it. Maybe it felt unreal[r]
because there was only blood there.[pcms]
*503|
[fc]
In other words... because I couldn't see the SUV's driver anywhere.[pcms]
*504|
[fc]
If that's the blood of the SUV's driver, then there must have been a[r]
significant amount of bleeding. In such a state, wouldn't it be[r]
impossible to move?[pcms]
*505|
[fc]
--Was he thrown somewhere? Or is he inside that crushed car?[pcms]
*506|
[fc]
Such thoughts were swirling in my head.[pcms]

Rui-senpai, who had somehow made her way to the driver's seat area,[r]
was asking the teacher.[pcms]
*512|
[fc]
The teacher's face had turned pale, and she looked like she might[r]
collapse at any moment.[pcms]

"Not there... Could the impact of the collision have thrown the driver[r]
somewhere?"[pcms]
*515|
[fc]
Rui-senpai voiced the same speculation as me, but the teacher just[r]
shook her head from side to side.[pcms]

[fc]
Apparently, by the time the compact car came upon the accident scene,[r]
the SUV's driver was already nowhere to be seen.[pcms]
*517|
[fc]
With such a collision, it wouldn't be strange if it were an instant[r]
death.[pcms]
*518|
[fc]
Even if they were alive, they'd likely have serious injuries. The[r]
amount of blood soaking the road proves that thought.[pcms]
*519|
[fc]
And yet, "not there"... Where on earth could they have disappeared to?[pcms]

As I muttered that to myself, something was placed on my arm.[pcms]
*522|
[fc]
It was Riri's hand, who had somehow come to stand beside me without me[r]
noticing.[pcms]
*523|
[fc]
Gently gripping my arm with her fingertips, Riri's hand was then[r]
covered by my own.[pcms]
*524|
[fc]
Trying to stop the trembling of her hand, which was smaller than I[r]
thought, I gripped it a bit more firmly and turned my gaze towards the[r]
forest spreading out beyond the window.[pcms]
*525|
[fc]
Although the deep green treetops swaying in the summer sunlight should[r]
be very beautiful, suddenly they seemed eerie, like some unknown[r]
entity.[pcms]

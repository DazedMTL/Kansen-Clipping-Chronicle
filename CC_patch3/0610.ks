In front of me, as I let out a voiceless groan, a tragedy was[r]
unfolding.[pcms]
*7534|
[fc]
Peering from the shadows at the campsite attached to the center, the[r]
same abnormal people from before were rampaging, turning it into a[r]
cauldron of chaos.[pcms]
*7535|
[fc]
Screams and shouts, groans and panic were echoing up into the night[r]

Women and men being stripped of their clothes and violated on the[r]
spot.[pcms]
*7537|

Others beating each other up, their bodies battered and torn.[pcms]

A man greedily devouring raw meat and fish, guzzling down alcohol as[r]
if bathing in it.[pcms]
*7541|
[fc]
And a group feasting on a still-living human being, who was screaming[r]
in agony and death throes.[pcms]

This scene was beyond this world--[pcms]
*7543|
[fc]
It was a sight that made me think even hell would be a bit more[r]
peaceful and sophisticated.[pcms]
*7544|
[fc]
I stumbled as I staggered forward, tripping over something.[pcms]
*7545|
[fc]
I braced my foot and endured it, but the effort caused something hot[r]
to rise from the pit of my stomach, and I vomited right there.[pcms]
*7546|
[fc]
The acid from my stomach burned my throat, and the curry I had seconds[r]
of was scattered over the underbrush.[pcms]
*7547|
[fc]
I must leave this place quickly...![pcms]
*7548|
[fc]
Vomiting as I went, I staggered back into the forest.[pcms]

The screams from the center hit my back as I left.[pcms]

I was so surprised when they suddenly attacked that I couldn't judge[r]
properly, but they were seriously injured, and under normal[r]
